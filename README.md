Hi and welcome in this Memory game challenge 👋

I hope you enjoy making this exciting game and have a good time on it 🎮.

## What you need to do
- Remove the homepage to redirect directly to the game page
- Build the memory game 
  - Create the game board
  - Display of player name, button to create a new game, number of turns
  - Save the result in store when we want to start a new game
- Display player name with rounds on rank page
- [BONUS] Persist the data of games played in order to allow the display of the results when the page reloads.
